## Description

Since my sweet childhood, I've always wanted to write my own story but I was knowing my lack of skills in story telling due to my young age.
And now, I tried to make my own story, and so I can for sure say that it was not my young age the issue.
So here an strange and not good story with choice made in Python, it is just another fun idea how appear in my mind.
Even George Lucas would be jealous of my talent

This Text-Adventure is in French only, sorry for all the non-french friends, I will update it one day :)
